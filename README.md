1. I filtered and found images where the baseline model couldn't detect defects, but the pruned model could. Conclusion: I reviewed five folders and believe these five show an increase in recall, but without a notable drop in precision and F-score. So far, no such images have been found in the first two folders. In the next three folders, some images, previously barely detected, now show more continuous and prominent contours after pruning.

2. I prepared team management meeting materials and had a meeting with Zhao.

3. Regarding the detection results of carpet_test_thread_016, Mr. Zhao found defects that the baseline model couldn't detect, but the pruned model could. I need to modify the code after the softmax activation function to allow the baseline model to detect these defects. Conclusion: Using a threshold of 0.00000000001, it is possible to balance noise levels and roughly detect the contours of two results.
