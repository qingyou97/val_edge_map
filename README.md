We believe the first method is the official PyTorch method, so I think it has the highest priority. Secondly, the second method is from the author's paper published at CVPR, so I put it in second priority. Then, among the options you provided, methods three and four. Based on this priority, I will first try the official PyTorch pruning. What do you think?
