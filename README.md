Regarding the additional information you provided in the meeting notice, I'd like to respond. I think I can prepare some information in advance for tomorrow's meeting, but I may have issues with the continuity and consistency of some information. I'm worried that the information I have might not be complete, so I'd like to include Dong. Is that okay?

Also, the meeting might involve discussions about the work status or other information of other members, so I'd prefer to move our meeting to another room in the main office. What do you think?
