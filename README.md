1、 Model Training 
- 1.1 Train Model with train data(10 pics)
2、Model Testing 
- 2.1 Implement test metrics with python and test the code
- 2.2 Test the model with a test dataset and provide the corresponding test metric data
3、Model Pruning
- 3.1 Research the method implementation in the reference paper
- 3.2 Write and test a python code to implement the model pruning mentioned above 
4、The model after pruning Testing
- 4.1 Modify the code in the step 2
- 4.2 Test the model with a test dataset and provide the corresponding test metric data
