The progress on generalization tasks is currently steady. I think our collaboration with Li Zhe went very smoothly last week, and I learned a lot about segmentation and generalization. Our team is becoming more organized. 
The experiments on generalization last week were still in an exploratory stage. I also forgot to analyze from a visualization perspective. I hope to find a clear direction for the experiments this week and explore the relationship between pruning and generalization.
