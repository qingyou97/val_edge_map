1. Easy to understand and implement: rule-based methods usually rely on simple mathematical operators, with concepts and algorithms being relatively straightforward, making them easy to implement.
2. High computational efficiency: due to their relatively simple computational process, the calculation speed is usually fast, making it suitable for real-time processing.
3. Strong controllability: parameters and rules are clearly defined, providing good controllability, and making them easy to debug and adjust.
