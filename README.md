The advantage of Laplace is that it can detect more details and high-frequency parts.
The disadvantage of Laplace is that it is very sensitive to noise and is prone to producing false edges.

The edge results from Canny detection have very few details and are often discontinuous, making it unsuitable for complex scenes. Occasionally, because of the very few edges detected, there are almost no incorrect edge points, leading to a higher precision out-of-the-box.
