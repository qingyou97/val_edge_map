The out of box comparison of the three algorithms shows that BDCN has thicker edges and more noise than pidinetd; The pidinet algorithm is more effective in detecting some details, but occasionally in some images, the noise can become significant; Dexined has the most details and good generalization.
In traditional methods, the overall quality is obviously poor, the detection details are few, and there is also a lot of noise.
三个算法的out-of-box对比，BDCN的边缘更粗，噪声比pidinetd多些；pidinet算法对于一些细节检测的更多了，但偶尔一些图像，噪声会变得很多；dexined的细节是最多的，泛化性也比较好。
传统方法中，明显整体性比较差，检测的细节也少，噪声也多。
