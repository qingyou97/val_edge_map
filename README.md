1.1 Test the metrics and visualize the results for the training, test, and validation sets in the BSDS dataset.
1.2 Configure the CUDA environment.
1.3 Conduct retraining experiment 1 with BDCN (using the BSDS pretrained model + using BSDS test set as training set + training for 40,000 epochs), twice in total.
1.4 Use F1-score to select the model, compare the performance of the two experiments with the out-of-the-box performance.
1.5 Identify the reasons for poor training results.
1.6 Investigate the principle of the F1 score.
2.1 Daily management of personnel and task pool.
2.2 Phase division of few-shot and generalization tasks.
