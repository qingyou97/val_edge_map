1. Study, explain, and output each pruning method (PyTorch official, torch-pruning paper). The purpose is to evaluate how long it would take to rewrite these methods using another framework like TensorFlow.
2. Study OpenVINO's model compression methods and principles, and determine the differences from the aforementioned pruning methods. The goal is to evaluate whether OpenVINO's methods are suitable for the project.
3. Deploy the UNet code, test, and organize all results from Li Zhe, including parameter tuning results and trends.
4. Deploy the UNet code, adopting a for-loop for future training and inference needs.
