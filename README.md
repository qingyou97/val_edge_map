1. Strong integrity: The unique structure ensures edge detection has integrity and continuity.
2. High accuracy: Advanced feature extraction enables the detection of finer edges, improving accuracy.
3. High robustness: Multi-scale fusion and data augmentation technologies make it stable across various conditions (different lighting, complex backgrounds).
4. Strong scalability: AI models can be easily extended to new tasks and datasets through transfer learning.
5. Reduced human intervention: After training, the detection process is largely automated, reducing labor costs.
