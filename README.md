In this week's testing and indicator organization tasks. I found that I was a bit too concerned about organizing the indicators, and instead forgot to analyze the results from a visual perspective. I only remembered this matter after your reminder this morning. I will conduct a more comprehensive analysis in the future.

I feel that my English communication with you is a bit more familiar than at the beginning, and now I can answer some of your questions. I will continue to work hard in the future.
