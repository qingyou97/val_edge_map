I have another question. Just now, Wang Chao tried to transfer Li Zhe's project and code to the jhc_ai folder, but found that due to too many files, it took a long time, sometimes showing 16 hours and sometimes showing 23 hours. And Li Zhe also needs to reconfigure the environment, etc. Perhaps it will take a long time. Anyway, Wang Chao also needs to reconfigure the environment because he needs to do the few shot task. What do you think about continuing to let Li Zhe do generalization tasks on Wang Chao's machine, and Wang Chao reconfiguring few shot tasks on Sun's machine?
