Regarding what you said this morning about finding the reasons for the increase or decrease in these indicators of pidinet. I would like to share my thoughts and hope that you can use your experience to determine if my approach is correct. I want to search from the following two aspects:
From a visual perspective, it leads to a decrease in recall and an increase in precision of pidinet compared to BDCN. I want to see if the edge map generated by pidinet has more noise and thicker edge lines.
2. From the perspective of model architecture, why does pidinet have a decrease in recall and an increase in precision compared to BDCN.
Based on your experience, is my approach correct?
