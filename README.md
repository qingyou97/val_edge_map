Weaknesses: Sometimes I'm not very meticulous and often make mistakes because I rush. For instance, I forget to set the learning rate when retraining or use parameters without thoroughly checking them. I assume that the pre-trained model parameters are fully set, which is not always the case.

Strengths:
1. Starting this week, I began managing tasks. Currently, I'm handling various technical and scrum management tasks simultaneously. I'm also communicating well with task owners, and the task progress is being tracked smoothly.
2. When handling Task Three, I was able to investigate and verify issues and abnormal results from multiple angles. I can explain these issues, find the root cause, and provide solutions.
