如果在后续训练中将初始学习率从之前的10e-6突然升高到10e-2，模型参数可能会跳出已经到达的极低损失点。建议继续使用较小的学习率（例如10e-6）进行后续训练，这样可以确保模型在已有的优化基础上更稳定、渐进地微调。
If the initial learning rate in subsequent training is suddenly increased from the previous 10e-6 to 10e-2, the model parameters might jump out of the already reached low loss point. It is recommended to continue using a small learning rate (such as 10e-6) for subsequent training, as this ensures that the model can be fine-tuned more stably and progressively on the existing optimized basis.
