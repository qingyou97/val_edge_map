1. Requires large amounts of data: Training highly accurate models usually needs a lot of labeled training data.
2. High computation and training costs: Inference and training require significant computing and storage resources, possibly demanding costly large-scale computing infrastructure.
3. High model complexity: Training and implementing these models are more complex than rule-based methods, requiring considerable computing resources and expertise.
4. Lack of interpretability and transparency: The decision-making process of the model is not transparent, often referred to as a black box, making it difficult to understand and explain.
5. Uncertain generalization performance: Models may perform well under specific conditions but may not generalize well under different or more complex conditions. They also depend heavily on data; if the application scenario differs significantly from the training set, the model may need retraining.
6. Noise sensitivity: Model performance is related to the specific algorithm and can be sensitive to data noise.
