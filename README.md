## Summary:
### 1.The overall performance of the BSDS dataset is the best.
### 2.The RGB part of the NYUD dataset performs better than the HHA part, especially in terms of edge intensity.
### 3.The Mutilcue dataset exhibits poor connectivity due to its complexity and noise.
### 4.Accuracy and recall show BSDS (train) and (test), especially on BSDS test data, the recall rate is still high, but the accuracy is slightly insufficient, indicating the possibility of false positive edge detection.
