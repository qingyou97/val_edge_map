Test indicator results:
BSDS Pre training vs. post training
analysis:
1. 信噪比的提升与召回率的显著增加，是较为积极的变化。（更清晰可见，更全面检测）
2. 然而，边缘强度减弱、连通分量与断点数剧增，可能反映出模型在整体视图下的边缘连续性未能有良好提升。
3. 精度和 f1-score 的小幅下降提示需要在如何减少错误预测和固保持续性连椎领域上再作调优。
1. The improvement of signal-to-noise ratio and the significant increase in recall rate are relatively positive changes. (clearer and more comprehensive detection)
2. However, the weakening of edge strength and the sharp increase in connected components and breakpoints may reflect that the model's edge continuity in the overall view has not been well improved.
3. The slight decrease in accuracy and F1 score suggests that further optimization is needed in the field of reducing erroneous predictions and maintaining sustained vertebral connectivity.

NYUDV2(HHA) Pre training vs. post training
analysis:
1. 在清晰度方面，尽管边缘强度下降了，但信噪比增加说明模型有更好的去噪能力。 
2. 连贯性指标都显著增强，表明模型已经变得更善于检测出更加整体化的边缘。 
3. 但位置精度和召回方面的下降提示训练方式中可能有过拟合或数据特征不匹配，使模型未能有效泛化。
1. In terms of clarity, although the edge strength has decreased, an increase in signal-to-noise ratio indicates that the model has better denoising ability.
2. The coherence indicators have significantly increased, indicating that the model has become better at detecting more integrated edges.
3. However, the decrease in positional accuracy and recall suggests that there may be overfitting or mismatched data features in the training method, which may prevent the model from effectively generalizing.


NYUD RGB Pre training vs. post training
analysis:
1. 清晰度方面，信噪比提升但边缘强度下降，说明检测信号可能变得更干净，但边缘识别的力度变弱。 
2. 连贯性方面，连贯区域增多，但也伴随断点数量大幅增加，可能提出了一些更多的边缘信息，但这些信息同时变得更加碎片化。 
3. 定位精度方面，虽然准确率和f1-score有所提升，但召回率大幅下降表明模型检测出正确边缘的数量减少。因此，模型在有些方面改进但丢失了部分整体性能，尤其在不是所有的正确边缘都能检测到的情况下。
1. In terms of clarity, the signal-to-noise ratio improves but the edge strength decreases, indicating that the detection signal may become cleaner, but the strength of edge recognition may become weaker.
2. In terms of coherence, the number of coherent regions increases, but it is also accompanied by a significant increase in the number of breakpoints, which may introduce more edge information, but these information also become more fragmented.
3. In terms of positioning accuracy, although the accuracy and F1 score have improved, the significant decrease in recall indicates a decrease in the number of correct edges detected by the model. Therefore, the model has improved in some aspects but lost some overall performance, especially when not all correct edges can be detected.

Multicue Pre training vs. post training
analysis:
1. 在清晰度方面（特别是信噪比），模型在训练后有所提升。 
2. 连续性（connected components 和 number of breakpoints）的恶化可能意味着效果不够稳定，边缘处理中断更多。
3. 位置准确性指标的下降表现出召回率和F1-score变差，意味着模型实际效果上的检测能力弱化。
1. In terms of clarity (especially signal-to-noise ratio), the model has improved after training.
2. The deterioration of connected components and number of breakpoints may indicate less stable performance and more interruptions in edge processing.
3. The decrease in position accuracy indicators indicates a decrease in recall rate and F1 score, indicating a weakening of the detection ability of the model in actual performance.

Comprehensive summary:
1. 经过训练，模型在某些指标上有改善，例如信噪比以及recall得到了明显提升。
2. 然而，训练后的复杂性和连续性显著提高，准确率（precision）有所下滑，精度表现略有波动。
3. 总体f1-score改变不大，但部分数据集的表现需进一步优化，确保精度和复杂度在可控范围内。
1. After training, the model has improved in certain indicators, such as signal-to-noise ratio and recall.
2. However, the complexity and continuity after training have significantly improved, with a decrease in accuracy and slight fluctuations in accuracy performance.
3. The overall F1 score has not changed much, but the performance of some datasets needs further optimization to ensure accuracy and complexity are within a controllable range.
