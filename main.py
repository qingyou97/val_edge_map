1. I had a meeting and reported the datasets I found, and I understood your requirements for the datasets.
2. According to the metal and engine directions, I found 11 datasets.
Conclusion: Currently, I found 2 engine turbine blade datasets, 2 casting product image datasets, 4 industrial part datasets, 1 industrial product dataset from MVTec, 1 automobile part dataset, and 1 metal can dataset. Whether they meet the standards needs further discussion with you.
Today's plan:
1. Perform inference and organize visualization results of BDCN, pidinet, and dexined on the selected datasets.
