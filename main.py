I tested and organized all six sets of data from V2 (pidinet), V3 (dexined-1), and V4 (dexined-2).

For the bottle:
- V3 (dexined-1) and V4 (dexined-2) both have five best results, performance is similar.

For casting:
- All results are better with V3 (dexined-1), fewer breakpoints, tidier edges.

For cylinder:
- V5 has the most detections. Before V5, V4 (dexined-2) has 16 best results, performs best with less noise and more continuous edges. V5 has the most detections.

For groove:
- V3 (dexined-1) has 11 best results. V4 (dexined-2) has 8. V5 has the most detections but also more noise. Similar performance to V3 (dexined-1), each has drawbacks.

For aero:
- V3 (dexined-1) has 3 best results. V4 (dexined-2) has 9. V5 has the most detections and more edges detected.

For ball-screw:
- V2 (pidinet) has 4 best results. V4 (dexined-2) has 14 and performs best with more edges detected. V5 has noticeably more noise.
