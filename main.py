Pros:
Preliminary conclusions have been reached for generalizability tasks based on time requirements, and experiments have identified the relationship between generalizability and pruning.

Cons:
Sometimes the time allocation for scrum managers and technical roles is poorly managed, leading to excessive pressure to meet technical goals, which results in overtime work.
