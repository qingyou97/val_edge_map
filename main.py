1024 Morning Meeting 10.30-11.00:
Duan:
1. Threshold modification: for example, if it exceeds 100, take the first one. If not, take the nearest lower, for example, above 75 as the final point.
2. Or modify the final point to take the first local maximum point.
3. After the sector result comes out, it should be cross-verified with the AI result, not solely depend on the sector result.
4. Test the groove dataset as well. Think about the logic for selecting ROI, such as the minimum bounding rectangle, etc.
Han:
1. Organize the before-and-after comparison charts.
2. Summarize representative examples of improvement and weakeningâ€”these two are significantly improved, these two are significantly weakened.
3. Deliverable should be organized according to viewpoints.
