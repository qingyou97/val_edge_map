Using bdcn results as an example,
In 5 categories of datasets, for images with small inter-class distance like 4-ball-screw, one image can be well-fitted.
For images with large inter-class distance, like 1-Aero-engine-defect and 2-casting-product-image, if one image is trained, it detects well for similar images.
But for other images, detection performance is poor.
All results of bdcn experiments are recorded in tables.
