Currently, I have noticed that Han's workload is now complete.
I'll organize the daily meeting minutes and post them in the Teams chat, using them as a checklist for both Han and me. The next day before the morning meeting, I'll prepare the daily work report based on the checklist.
Since adopting this checklist workflow, I feel Han's work efficiency has greatly improved.
