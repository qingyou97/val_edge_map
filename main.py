I have an idea. Currently, out-of-the-box, DexiNed is the best. The author claims this is because they used their finely annotated BIPEDv2 dataset (Believing that the BDCN and PiDiNet used BSDS, which was initially a segmentation dataset and of lower quality for edge detection tasks). But when we used DexiNed to train an image, we found that the results were consistently poor. I am now considering training PiDiNet on the BIPEDv2 dataset to see if we can enhance the out-of-the-box performance of PiDiNet. That way, combined with PiDiNet's good performance in training on a single image, it could very likely become our final model. What do you think?
