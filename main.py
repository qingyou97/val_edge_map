I am currently using GIMP image processing software to annotate edge detection images. It is an open-source tool for image processing and composition. While it is not specifically designed for edge detection annotation, I believe it can be used for this purpose since I haven't found specialized edge annotation tools. I have documented every detailed step of using it in a Word document. Additionally, I have recorded other non-usable software I came across during my search.
