1. Organize and compare the results of TEED reasoning
2. There are a total of 121 scenarios for PiDiNet. 100 models each trained on one image at a time, 1 model trained on all 100 images at once, 20 models trained on 3/5/7/9 images from 5 different datasets each time. Today, select 3 scenarios out of these 121, and make predictions and reasoning for 100, 200, and 299 epochs. Calculate recall, precision, and F1 score against GT (ground truth).
3. BDCN trains on 3/5/7/9 images each time.
4. PiDiNet trains on the BIPED dataset.
