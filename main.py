Here is my summary after reading the pidinet code and paper on reading gt. My conclusion is that the pidinet paper and code indeed set a threshold to discard some part of the gt. I used to think there were only pixel values of 0 and 255 in my png images converted from 7 people's annotated mat, but my code was actually problematic. This caused my use of the default 0.3 threshold in the project to discard pixel values of 51, resulting in incorrect training results. So, I re-experimented using a 0.1 threshold to ensure all pixels in my gt were preserved. I also updated the training results in the table. The results are different when training with gt annotated by 7 people versus gt annotated by 1 person.
All the steps are documented in this Word file.
