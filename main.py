Morning meeting 10-11, 10.00-10.40:

Han:
1. The idea of dcama lightweighting doesn't need to be so constrained and concluded quickly. Take more time to think it through. Try adding something similar to conv.
2. In the summary document, clarify which architectures or parameters were changed and what trends resulted from these changes. Not just the phenomena. After summarizing the trends, you can propose solutions.

Duan:
1. Currently, maintain the scheme that keeps the maximum point nearest to the inner diameter but needs further fine-tuning.
2. Customized scheme with alternating light and dark areas.
3. Try other datasets like groove and cylinder since it's proven to be effective on casting. Check if it works on other datasets. Fine-tuning can be done later.
