1. What is the annotation tool used by DexiNed, and how to find Sun Zhen?
2. Delete non-compliant images when doing the test with the remaining images. (For future training, take 20 for training)
3. When training flowers with DexiNed, first, 70 epochs are too few. Try more epochs to see if it can fit. Second, don't let the learning rate drop; train directly with 0.001 and see the effect. 
4. Train using an image on BDCN.
5. After annotating the data, train with one image and test it.
