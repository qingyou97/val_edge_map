First, I trained, pruned, and tested the remaining six datasets. Li Zhe helped me to select these six datasets. Second, I organized four importance methods. Because this method is quite special and different from ordinary pruning, I would like to meet with you this afternoon to explain it in detail. Third, I screened the detection results of three baseline models. The current conclusion is that the pruning effect of the three baseline models shows that there are cases where the baseline model cannot detect, but the pruned model can detect, indicating enhanced generalization ability, but it significantly reduces the detection ability of other images. I have recorded the selected images in the table. Today, I will analyze the visualization results of the remaining datasets to understand the relationship between generalization and pruning. I will also analyze the relationship between pruning range and generalization.
