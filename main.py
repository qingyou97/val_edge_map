3. Writing a for-loop script to train data from 7 folders.
4. Selected the first trained model and viewed the detection results of the baseline model for cable images. Currently believe there is no overfitting and the detection is quite good.
5. Writing a for-loop script for cyclic pruning and inference in torch-pruning, adjusting parameters including importance method, p, quantity, and iteration times.
6. Explanation of the torch-pruning method. Some methods still need to be detailed and further investigated.
7. Created a follow-up plan in the afternoon.
