I just checked the cylinder dataset. The bottom edge I drew is the inner diameter, and it's correct.

Illustration:
But I noticed that the second and third edges from the top, like the casting, have two layers of edges. I checked the guideline you marked for me previously, which falls in the middle of these layers. Which edge should I use?
