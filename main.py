1. Testing and organizing results of the polar coordinate algorithm
Conclusion: The results for a single image processed on my computer are done (processing for other images continues on someone else's machine). The effect is not better than the previous version based on finding peak points via the circle center. However, it clearly avoids a specific scenario, "if many consecutive pixels are good, but only one or two pixels are offset," this situation can be avoided. But when a large area of the region has larger peak points on the outer edge, it completely biases towards the outer contour. File link:

2. List the follow-up experimental plans for rule-based, and send the organized files to Mr. Zhao
Conclusion: Yesterday, I thought about and did some small experiments, resulting in three subsequent schemes. They are organized in this file. File link:
