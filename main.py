1. Apply rule-based methods directly on AI results, and apply rule-based methods directly on the original image. Compare with GT to determine if the thin edge locations are desired.
2. When doing rule-based, find peak intensity and explore direction. Use Sobel on the original image to get intensity and direction, and check if you can decide peak and direction to adjust the edge.
3. Look for other methods to find matching thin edges.
