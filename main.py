Meeting 1:30-2:30 PM on October 10:

Han Xu:
1. Summarize patterns.
2. Oneshot is inconsistent in some parts; out-of-box is continuous, but there’s inconsistency after fusion. How to solve this?
3. Summarize topics similar to above; finetuning direction needs to follow these topics (main point).
4. Replicate sigmoid results, and organize.
5. Edit milestone, then report back; what viewpoints, what effects achieve.

Duan:
6. Overlay ground truth on original image, confirm where ground truth layer is (maybe dilation is causing both layer edges to be learned).
7. Handwrite specification: keep bright-to-dark transition, keep the inner edge. If AI doesn't work, use rule-based custom solution for edge.
8. Use Han’s dexined results for experiment.
9. Handwrite specification, keep peak closer to inner diameter.
10. Handwrite rule: keep first peak, discard second peak.
