Duan:
1. Monday: Select multiple baseline models and check other datasets and defect types to see if there is overfitting.
2. Tuesday and Wednesday: Use the torch-pruning method to prune the parameters of all selected baseline models according to the scope chosen by Li Zhe. Record all visualization results.
3. Thursday: Compare all experiments of Li Zhe with all my own experiments, unify the format of deliverables, and organize my torch-pruning results. Compare with Li Zhe's experimental results.
4. Friday: Jointly discuss the conclusions of pruning and generalization, and discuss the next steps, including explanations of the results with the official PyTorch pruning method.

Li Zhe:
5. Monday: Based on the experiments, select the results of the pruning scope.
6. Tuesday and Wednesday: Use the official PyTorch pruning method to prune the parameters of all selected baseline models according to the chosen scope. Record all visualization results.
7. Thursday: Organize my PyTorch official experiments according to Duan's format and compare with Duan's experimental results.
8. Friday: Jointly discuss the conclusions of pruning and generalization, explain the results of the official PyTorch pruning method, and discuss the next steps.
