10/16 - Morning Meeting 10:00-10:40:
Duan:
1. Overlay the known results with the original gt image to see if the desired gt has been extracted.
2. For the cylinder dataset, check the gt annotations and see if lighting issues affect gt extraction.
3. Organize yesterday's new Dexined results from Han Xu and make comparisons.
4. Determine if some noise issues can be solved by a rule-based method.

Han Xu:
5. Test with multiple support, and then provide it to Duan. Duan will do the rule-based part.
6. Improve the tuning for the merge layer algorithm, e.g., the edges detected by Dexined should not be filtered out during merging.
