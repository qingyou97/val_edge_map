I have a question. I tried several bilinear interpolation interfaces. When set to 1/2, it can keep the borders as one pixel, but there are breakpoints. I searched for solutions, most suggest using bilinear interpolation (`order=1`) or bicubic interpolation (`order=3`), but this may introduce grayscale values and need post-processing to binarize it again. Do you have other suggestions?
