I have a question. You mentioned this morning that in a classifier we should write a simple decoder to help combine features, using upsampling within it. We need to use the nearest neighbor interpolation method. I thought about it, since sum1 to sum5 are all 21 channels but different in size. If we use a fixed conv in the encoder and interpolate and concat in the decoder, it becomes multi-channel again. Unless we consider adding each feature map, then it can stay single-channel. Is this reasonable? Or should the classifier do the sampling first, then go through a conv to output a single channel?
